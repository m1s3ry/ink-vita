Patch to make INK playable on PS Vita

###

## Disclaimer
This patch does not contain any game files from INK. **You need the game files from your legally owned copy**.
If you don't have a copy of the game, you can buy it [HERE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/385710/INK/)
It **WILL NOT WORK* with a pirated copy of the game due to hash check.

## Instructions (Read them carefully)
1. Download the VPK and install it on your hacked PS Vita
2. In your PC, open the folder when you have installed INK (Steam only at the moment). If you only have a .exe, extract it with 7zip.
3. Download the patch for your version and extract it in that folder. After that, run `apply_patch.bat`. This will create a folder called `Patched_Files`
4. If everything went correctly, your Patched_Files folders will have a file called `eboot.bin` and a folder called `games` with a `game.win` file.
5. Copy `eboot.bin` and the `games` folder and move them to the vita, `ux0:app/INKV00000`. Overwrite when prompted. 
6. Copy every `.ogg` file from your PC's INK folder to `ux0:app/INKV00000/games`

**IMPORTANT:** This patch is not confirmed to work with any other version that it's not the current latest build of Steam.
